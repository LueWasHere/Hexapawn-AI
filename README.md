# Hexapawn-AI
A hexapawn AI
Based on the matchbox computer concept. Inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/sw7UAZNgGg8) Vsauce video
# How it works
There is a json file called "dat_d.json" this file contains (what I believe to be) every board state and possible move. When you beat the AI in a certain senario it removes the
last move it made from its list of moves, using this concept the AI is able to "learn"

A default version of the AI's moves can be found in the "default_ai" folder
